             <b> The manuscript should be submitted according to format as follow:</b>

             <br/> <br/>  <b>Manuscript Preparation</b>              
             <br/>
             <b>Article structure</b> <br/>
             Follow this order when submitting manuscripts: Title, Authors, Affiliations, Abstract, Keywords, Main text, Acknowledgements, References, Appendix, Figure Captions and then Tables. Collate acknowledgments in a separate section at the end of the article and do not include them on the title page, as a footnote to the title or otherwise. <br/> <br/>

 <b>Text Layout</b> <br/>

Use single line spacing and wide (3 cm) margins (Left justified.) Ensure that each new paragraph is clearly indicated. Present tables, figures and figure legends at the point they will appear in the manuscript. Number all pages consecutively; use 12 font sizes in Times New Roman fonts.

<br/> <b>Subdivision – numbered sections</b> <br/>

Divide your article into clearly defined and numbered sections. Subsections should be numbered 1.1 (then 1.1.1, 1.1.2, …), 1.2, etc. (the abstract is not included in section numbering). Use this numbering also for internal cross-referencing: do not just refer to ‘the text’. Any subsection may be given a br/ief heading. Each heading should appear on its own separate line.

<br/> <b>Introduction</b> <br/>

State the objectives of the work and provide an adequate background followed by literature survey in br/ief and summary of the results.

<br/>  <b>Material and methods</b> <br/>

Provide sufficient detail to allow the work to be reproduced. Methods already published should be indicated by a reference: only relevant modifications should be described.

<br/>  <b>Theory/calculation</b>  <br/>

A Theory section should extend, not repeat, the background to the article already dealt with in the introduction section and lay the foundation for proposed work. In contrast, a Calculation section represents a practical development from a theoretical basis.

<br/>  <b>Results</b>  <br/>  
Results should be clear and concise.

<br/>  <b>Discussion</b> <br/>
This should explore the significance of the results of the work, not repeat them. A combined Results and Discussion section is often appropriate. Avoid extensive citations and discussion of published literature.

<br/>  <b>Conclusions</b> <br/>
The main conclusions of the study/work may be presented in a short concise manner in the conclusions section.

<br/><br/> <b >Essential title page information</b> 


<br/> <b>Title</b>  <br/> 

Should be Concise and informative. Titles are often used in information-retrieval systems. Avoid abbr/eviations and formulae where possible.

<br/> <b>Author names and affiliations</b> <br/> 

Please clearly indicate the given name(s) and family name(s) of each author and check that all names are accurately spelled. Present the authors’ affiliation addresses (where the actual work was done) below the names. Indicate all affiliations with a lower-case superscript letter immediately after the author’s name and in front of the appropriate address. Provide the full postal address of each affiliation, including the country name and, if available, the e-mail address of each author.

<br/> <b>Corresponding author </b>  <br/>

Clearly indicate who will handle correspondence at all stages of refereeing and publication, also post-publication. Ensure that the e-mail address is given and that contact details are kept up to date by the corresponding author.

<br/> <b>Present/permanent address</b> <br/>

If an author has moved since the work described in the article was done, or was visiting at the time, a ‘Present address’ (or ‘Permanent address’) may be indicated as a footnote to that author’s name. The address at which the author actually did the work must be retained as the main, affiliation address. Superscript Arabic numerals are used for such footnotes.

<br/> <b>Abstract</b>  <br/>

A self-contained abstract of 100 words, outlining in a single paragraph the aims, scope and conclusions of the paper must be supplied. The abstract should state br/iefly the purpose of the research, the principal results and major conclusions.

<br/> <b>Keywords</b>  <br/>

Immediately after the abstract, provide a maximum of 6 keywords and avoiding general and plural terms and multiple concepts (avoid, for example, ‘and’, ‘of’). These keywords will be used for indexing purposes.

<br/> <b>Acknowledgements</b>  <br/>

Collate acknowledgements in a separate section at the end of the article before the references and do not, therefore, include them on the title page, as a footnote to the title or otherwise. List here those individuals who provided help during the research (e.g., providing language help, writing assistance or proof reading the article, etc.).

<br/> <b>Formatting of funding sources</b>  <br/>

List funding sources in this standard way to facilitate compliance to funder’s requirements:

<br/> <b>Funding:</b>  <br/>
This work was supported by the XXXXXXXX[grant numbers xxxx, yyyy] and the Bill &amp; XXXXXXXXX [grant number zzzz].

If no funding has been provided for the research, please include the following sentence:

This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.

<br/> <b>Nomenclature and units</b> <br/>

Follow internationally accepted rules and conventions: use the international system of units (SI). If other quantities are mentioned, give their equivalent in SI.

<br/>  <b>Math formulae</b> <br/>

Please submit math equations as editable text and not as images. Present simple formulae in line with normal text where possible and use the solidus (/) instead of a horizontal line for small fractional terms, e.g., X/Y. In principle, variables are to be presented in italics. Powers of e are often more conveniently denoted by exp. Number consecutively any equations that have to be displayed separately from the text (if referred to explicitly in the text).

<br/> <b>Artwork</b> <br/>

<br/> <b> Electronic artwork</b><br/>

General points:

Make sure you use uniform lettering and sizing of your original artwork.

Embed the used fonts if the application provides that option.

Aim to use the fonts Times New Roman.

Number the illustrations according to their sequence in the text.

Use a logical naming convention for your artwork files.

Provide captions to illustrations separately.

Size the illustrations close to the desired dimensions of the published version.

Submit each illustration as a separate file.

<br/> <b>Formats</b> <br/>

If your electronic artwork is created in a Microsoft Office application (Word, PowerPoint, Excel) then please supply ‘as is’ in the native document format.

Regardless of the application used other than Microsoft Office, when your electronic artwork is finalized, please ‘Save as’ or convert the images to one of the following formats (note the resolution requirements for line drawings, halftones, and line/halftone combinations given below):

EPS (or PDF): Vector drawings, embed all used fonts.

TIFF (or JPEG): Color or grayscale photographs (halftones), keep to a minimum of 300 dpi.

TIFF (or JPEG): Bitmapped (pure black &amp; white pixels) line drawings, keep to a minimum of 1000 dpi.

TIFF (or JPEG): Combinations bitmapped line/half-tone (color or grayscale), keep to a minimum of 500 dpi.

<br/> <b>Color artwork</b> <br/>

Please make sure that artwork files are in an acceptable format (TIFF (or JPEG), EPS (or PDF), or MS Office files) and with the correct resolution.

<br/>  <b>Figure captions</b>  <br/>

Ensure that each illustration has a caption. Supply captions separately, not attached to the figure. A caption should comprise a br/ief title (not on the figure itself) and a description of the illustration. Keep text in the illustrations themselves to a minimum but explain all symbols and abbr/eviations used.

<br/> <b>Tables</b> <br/>

Please submit tables as editable text and not as images. Tables can be placed either next to the relevant text in the article, or on separate page(s) at the end. Number tables consecutively in accordance with their appearance in the text and place any table notes below the table body. Be sparing in the use of tables and ensure that the data presented in them do not duplicate results described elsewhere in the article.

<br/><br/><br/> <b>References</b> 

<br/> <b>Citation in text</b> <br/>

Please ensure that every reference cited in the text is also present in the reference list (and vice versa). The style of reference should be as follow:
